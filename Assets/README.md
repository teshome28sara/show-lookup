# 07 Project 1: Interactive Front-End Application

## user Story

> As a TV show enthusiast, I am looking for an app that can look up information on my favorite tv shows. Show Lookup, is an interactive front end application, that allows me to  look up any tv show. When I enters a given name of a tv show, the Show Look up appplication will fetch the data from a tv show API and displays information for me to look through. I  have  the ability to scroll through several options of a tv show with similar names to what I am looking for and then choosing the one that I  want, when I click on the image associated with a given tv show, i am presented with a pop up  modal box letting me know how i can save the show's image to local storage, then after saving the show's image, I can navigate to a link which will take me to the page where my selected show images are saved. These images are a link to the given show's official website.
